"""Append-only audit log for Skill Studio mutations.

JSON Lines format, one event per line, flushed and fsynced on every write.
Reads are capped (tail-style) so a malicious or bloated log can't blow up
the process — we keep it simple and don't rotate here; operators can
truncate or rename the file between runs if it gets too large.

Audit events we care about (callers pass these as ``event_type``):
    skill.create / skill.update / skill.delete / skill.restore_trash
    snapshot.create / snapshot.delete / snapshot.restore
    import.github
    trash.purge

Every event carries:
    ts           ISO-8601 timestamp with microseconds
    event_type   string
    actor        username or session id (free-form, caller supplies)
    skill_name   the skill this concerns (or None for global events)
    details      dict with event-specific fields
    ok           bool — did the action succeed?
